**Description of the File Handling Utility**

This Java application serves as a file handling tool that shows how to use common file I/O operations in Java to write, read, and edit text files. By writing initial content, displaying it, adding more notes, and

displaying the final updated content, users can work with a file (sample.txt).

The following are the main features of the program:

Writing to a File: After the user enters the program's initial content, BufferedWriter is used to write it to a file. This guarantees effective writing and replaces any old files with the updated information.

Reading from a File: The application uses BufferedReader to read and display the file content line by line after writing. This aids in confirming that the data has been appropriately stored.

A Pending Additional Notes: The user is requested to enter a brief note. After that, this note is added to the current file without replacing the earlier content. To do this, the application makes use of 

FileWriter in append mode.

Showing Updated Content: The application reads and shows the updated content to reflect the modifications made after the note has been added.

Key Java I/O concepts, including file creation, writing, reading, appending, and exception handling, are illustrated by this utility. It guides the interaction with clear console messages and clean code 

practices. Beginners learning file operations and Java's real-time input/output handling will find the program helpful.
